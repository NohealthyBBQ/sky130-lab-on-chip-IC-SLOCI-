# VGA design
update1(8/11): Simulation1.sch file includes all the circuit components for all kinds of simulation. It doesn't include any symbol because of some simulation bugs in ngspice. However, for easy layout, I will make all similar circuit blocks into individual symbols (only for layout usage). 
update2(8/12): Besides simulation1.sch file, other files are schematic and symbol files for layout use only. They include fist stage amp with offset cancellation, normal stage amp, cmfb, output buffer(but doesn't include the filters for offset cancellation because some compnents are external).
